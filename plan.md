Create an application Dish Calorie Calculator

Where you would write a nutritions and weight of each component in the dish
And it outputs the nutritions of the dish per 100 gr

E.g 2 eggs (120gr | 150cal per 100gr | 12/10/0 per 100 gr (protein/fat/carbs) ) +
2 sausages(75gr | 225cal per 100 gr | 10/6/0) +
Cheese (16.25gr | 270 cal per 100 gr | 20/15/0)

OUTPUT:
Eggs - 180cal - 16/12/0
Sausages - 170cal - 8/4/0
Cheese - 44 cal - 3/2/0

Total weight - 211gr.
Total nutritions - 394cal 27/18/0.
Per 100gr - 186cal 12/8/0

Also as an idea we can make API call to 3rd party resource and search for this info

- Create a single page app where by default we will have 2 lines with 5 input fields (weight/calorie per 100gr and optional nutrition inputs (protein/fat/carbs)) - V
- Add ability to add additional lines (additional ingridiends) and delete them as well - V
- Add output button to get results - V
- Add validations for fields, and error messages - V
- Add ingredient name inputs - V

- Create save for just created dish (add custom name) - V
- Create separate page with all saved dishes - V
- Create edit and delete bnts for each recipe - V
- Create removeInputBtn separate for each ingredient
- Create manual dish addition
- Save to cookies the names of the dishes?
- Create export tool?
